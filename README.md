Hello there !!! 👋🌞

I'm Guillaume, a 22-year-old junior fullstack web developer. 🤓

Currently, I'm on the lookout for an apprenticeship in a professional contract to enhance my experience in development. 📚

I'm a student at Ada tech school, a feminist and inclusive web development school, for just under a year. 🌈♀️💪🏽

My development stack includes, Javascript, Node.js, React, Express.js and PHP. 💻💻

I believe in diversity and equality; that's why I chose a feminist school. 🌈🌍

I love diving into real projects, trying my hand at everything, and learning on the fly. 📚

If you're looking for someone motivated, ready to apply their skills, and eager to learn more, I'm your guy! 🌟🌟

At 22, I'm excited to kickstart my career in web development, tackle challenges, and contribute to interesting projects. 🙌🙌

If you want someone passionate and enthusiastic, I'm your man! 🔥🔥🔥
